# PhosPiR
An automatic pipeline to analyze phosphoproteomics.

It is fully tested on Windows.

A few things to pay attention to: n/
-Should have good internet connection /n/
-When running statistical analysis, try not to click on the running window, sometimes the window will become “non-responding” when clicked, the cutoff selection window, for example, when pops up after statistical analysis will not display property from “non-responding” R windows /n
-Should leave enough space in your storage drive, 1-2G should be enough /n
